<h3>Copyright Restrictions</h3>
<p>The copyright law of the United States (Title 17, United States Code) governs the making of photocopies or other
    reproductions of copyright material. Under certain conditions specified in the law, libraries and archives are
    authorized to furnish a photocopy or other reproduction. One of these specified conditions is that the photocopy or
    reproduction is not to be "used for any purpose other than private study, scholarship, or research." If a user
    makes a request for, or later uses a photocopy or reproduction for purposes in excess of "fair use," that user may
    be liable for copyright infringement. This institution reserves the right to refuse to accept a copying order if,
    in its judgment, fulfillment of the order would involve violation of copyright law.</p>
